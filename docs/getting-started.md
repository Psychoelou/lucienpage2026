# Getting Started with EventSeats

Welcome to EventSeats! This guide will help you set up your own event booking system in just a few minutes.

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:
- **Node.js 18+** ([Download here](https://nodejs.org/))
- **Git** ([Download here](https://git-scm.com/))
- **Supabase account** ([Sign up free](https://supabase.com/))


### Step 1: Get the Code

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Hannah-goodridge/eventseats.git
cd eventseats

# Run the setup script
npm run setup
```

The setup script will:
- ✅ Check your Node.js version
- ✅ Install dependencies
- ✅ Create your `.env.local` file

### Step 2: Set Up Your Database

EventSeats uses **Supabase** (a PostgreSQL database) for storing all your data.

#### Create Supabase Project

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com/) and sign up
2. Click "New Project"
3. Choose a name (e.g., "my-eventseats")
4. Set a strong database password
5. Wait for the project to be ready (2-3 minutes)

#### Get Your Credentials

1. In your Supabase project dashboard, go to **Settings → API**
2. Copy these values:
   - **Project URL** (starts with `https://...supabase.co`)
   - **anon public key** (starts with `eyJ...`)
   - **service_role key** (starts with `eyJ...`)

#### Update Your Environment

Edit the `.env.local` file that was created:

```env
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_project_url_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here

# NextAuth Configuration
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_random_secret_here

# Optional: Stripe for payments (hosted Checkout)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
# Required for webhooks (local: from Stripe CLI; prod: from Dashboard)
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
```

**💡 Tip:** For `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`, generate a random string:
```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

### Step 3: Set Up Your Database Schema

You have two options:

#### Option A: Use Our SQL Script (Recommended)

1. In Supabase, go to **SQL Editor**
2. Create a new query
3. Copy and paste the contents of `database-setup.sql` from this repository
4. Click "Run"
5. Then copy and paste the contents of `docs/setup-demo-user.sql`
6. Click "Run" again
7. If you have an existing database, you can re-run the SQL to ensure the latest schema.

#### Option B: Use the TypeScript Seed Script

```bash
npm run setup-demo
```

### Step 4: Start Your Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your EventSeats system!

### Step 5: Sign In

Use these demo credentials to sign in:
- **Email:** `admin@democentre.org`
- **Password:** `demo123`

Go to [http://localhost:3000/admin/login](http://localhost:3000/admin/login) to access the admin panel.
