## 🚀 Getting Started

### Development Environment Setup

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/eventseats.git
   cd eventseats
   ```

3. **Add upstream remote**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/Hannah-goodridge/eventseats.git
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. **Set up environment variables**:
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env.local
   # Edit .env.local with your database and API keys
   ```

6. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Development Workflow

1. **Create a new branch** for your feature/fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following our coding standards
3. **Test thoroughly** - run existing tests and add new ones
4. **Commit your changes** with a clear message
5. **Push to your fork** and create a Pull Request

## 📝 Coding Standards

### TypeScript & JavaScript

- Use **TypeScript** for all new code
- Follow **ESLint** configuration (run `npm run lint`)
- Use **meaningful variable names** and add comments for complex logic
- Prefer **functional components** with hooks over class components

### Code Style

```typescript
// ✅ Good - Clear, typed, documented
interface BookingFormProps {
  onSubmit: (data: BookingData) => void
  isLoading: boolean
}

const BookingForm: React.FC<BookingFormProps> = ({ onSubmit, isLoading }) => {
  // Component logic here
}

// ❌ Avoid - Unclear, no types
const BookingForm = (props) => {
  // ...
}
```

### Database & API

- Use **Supabase client** for database operations
- Add **proper error handling** for all API calls
- Include **TypeScript types** for all API responses
- Follow **RESTful conventions** for new endpoints

### CSS & Styling

- Use **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- Create **reusable components** in `/src/components/ui/`
- Ensure **mobile responsiveness** for all new features
- Test on different screen sizes

## 🧪 Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Writing Tests

- Add tests for **new components** and **API endpoints**
- Use **React Testing Library** for component tests
- Mock **external dependencies** (APIs, database calls)
- Test **both success and error cases**

Example test structure:
```typescript
describe('BookingForm', () => {
  it('should submit booking data when form is valid', () => {
    // Test implementation
  })

  it('should show validation errors for invalid data', () => {
    // Test implementation
  })
})
```

## 🌍 Internationalization

We welcome translations! EventSeats uses **react-i18next** for internationalization.

### Adding a New Language

1. **Create translation file**: `src/locales/[language-code].json`
2. **Copy from English**: Use `src/locales/en.json` as template
3. **Translate all strings**
4. **Add language to config**: Update `src/lib/i18n.ts`
5. **Test thoroughly** with your language

### Translation Guidelines

- Keep **UI text concise** but descriptive
- Maintain **consistent terminology** throughout
- Consider **cultural differences** in date/time formats
- Test with **longer text** to ensure UI doesn't break

## 🎨 Themes & Customization

### Creating Themes

EventSeats supports custom themes through CSS variables and Tailwind configuration.

1. **Create theme file**: `src/styles/themes/your-theme.css`
2. **Define CSS variables** for colors, fonts, spacing
3. **Test across all components**
4. **Add documentation** for theme usage

### Theme Guidelines

- Ensure **accessibility** (contrast ratios, focus states)
- Test with **different content lengths**
- Support both **light and dark modes** if possible
- Follow **brand guidelines** for venue-specific themes

## 📚 Documentation

### Types of Documentation

- **User guides** - How to use features
- **Admin guides** - Managing the system
- **Developer docs** - API references, setup guides
- **Deployment guides** - Production deployment

### Documentation Standards

- Use **clear, simple language**
